From my inital poke at the processing 4 and processing 5.js repos, implementing pattern matching may be more similar than we originally thought.
On the java side, it seams that most of their code is manipulating the java.awt package, obsfuscating some of the complexity from the user.
Implementing pattern matching into p4 looks like it will be creating a class PMatch (to fit the rest of their standards) to deal with the pattern matching, and placing it in processing4/core/src/processing/core. either that, or modifying PApplet, or both.
