As part of my research over the past two weeks, I have successfully trained a custom data set. I did encounter a number of issues, which I will go through now because discussing the results.

I originally grabbed a 200 image dataset focused on chess pieces, this dataset had already been annoanted and put into a yolov8 format. When I began the training, I noticed it was occuring very slowly, so after some investigation I realised it wasn't using the GPU, this was determined by observing the activity monitor on mac. To get around this, when launching a training session, you have to specify that it will use the GPU, and this achieved by setting 'device=mps'.

This improved the speed, but resulted in a new issue which is that the metrics that you want to be observing as the training the dataset, are no longer visible. The training is still occuring, and will work as a model once completed, but no metrics to see progression.

Seems to be a common issue on apple silicon macs, as far as I could find there is no solution, aside from using the CPU, but slowness being the tradeoff. https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/9113 - According to this may be labelling issues of the dataset, or other.

In terms of metrics I can no longer observe are as follows -
1. box_loss
2. cls_loss
3. dls_loss
4. box P
5. box R
6. mAP50
7. mAP50-95
