# Image Segmentation Vs Object Detection
Image segmentation is a technique used in computer vision that divides a digital image into separate segments or groups of pixels. This process is essential for tasks such as object detection because it simplifies the complex visual information in an image into more manageable sections. By organising the image's data into distinct segments, image segmentation facilitates quicker and more sophisticated image processing techniques.

Object detection is a task in computer vision that focuses on identifying and locating objects within digital images. This task falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence, where the goal is to train computers to mimic human vision by recognising and categorising objects into different semantic groups. Object localisation is a related method used to pinpoint the exact position of specific objects in an image, typically by marking them with a bounding box.

Overall, image segementation is much more precise.
