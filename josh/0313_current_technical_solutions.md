# Current Technical Solutions For Object Detection Using AI 

# Overview

# What is object detection 
Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within an image or video. Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects.

Object detection can be broken down into machine learning-based approaches and deep learning-based approaches.

In more traditional ML-based approaches, computer vision techniques examine various features of an image, such as the colour histogram or edges, to identify groups of pixels that may belong to an object. These features are then fed into a regression model that predicts the object's location and label.

On the other hand, deep learning-based approaches employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform end-to-end, unsupervised object detection, in which features donâ€™t need to be defined and extracted separately
